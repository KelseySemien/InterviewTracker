# InterviewTracker 

A web app to help users track job interviews and their application statuses — built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project was created to practice DOM manipulation, dynamic UI updates, and managing user-driven data in the browser.

## About

**InterviewTracker** is a simple but functional tool for tracking job interview details like company name, position, date, and current status. Users can add records and see them listed on the page. The app demonstrates how to work with user inputs, update the DOM dynamically, and store simple lists in the browser.

This is a front-end project that highlights interactive HTML forms, JavaScript logic, and visual feedback for user actions.

## How It Works

1. The app presents a form where the user enters interview details.  
2. When the form is submitted, JavaScript captures the input values.  
3. A new interview item is created and displayed on the page.  
4. The list updates without refreshing the page.
